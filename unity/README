Doing a new source deployment:

* configure and build locally:
   
    ./configure --disable-audio --disable-shared --disable-dbus --enable-wayland-shared --disable-video-mir
    make clean
    make

* verify that sources.list is up to date and that there's nothing new in there you don't want:

    mv ./unity/sources.list ./unity/sources.list.old
    ./unity/find-src.sh > ./unity/sources.list
    bcompare ./unity/sources.list.old ./unity/sources.list

* if there is extra cruft in there you want to omit, add them to the blacklist in `./unity/find-src.sh` and repeat the above step

* generate the files that will be copied into External (outputted in `./deploy`):

    ./unity/deploy.bash

* copy the contents of the `./deploy` directory into External/SDL2 in your Unity clone:

    rm -rf <your branch>/External/SDL2/src <your branch>/External/SDL2/include
    cp -r ./deploy/* <your branch>/External/SDL2/

* verify Linux Player build:

    cd <your branch>
    ./jam LinuxPlayer


Deploying for a new platform:
* coordinate with Levi :-)
