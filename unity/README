Doing a new source deployment:
* configure (with --disable-audio --disable-shared --disable-dbus --enable-wayland-shared --disable-video-mir) and build locally
* verify that sources.list is up to date
* run deploy.bash
* copy the contents of the deploy directory into External/SDL2 in your unity clone
* verify linux player build

Deploying for a new platform:
* coordinate with Levi :-)
